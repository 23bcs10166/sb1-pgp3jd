VALID – AI-Based Deepfake Detection System
VALID is an AI-powered deepfake detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and verify the authenticity of digital content, such as images, videos, and audio. It aims to identify manipulated media and safeguard against misinformation, identity theft, and fraud.

Project Overview
With the rise of deepfake technology, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and manipulated content. VALID uses advanced AI algorithms to detect deepfakes, ensuring digital content's authenticity and protecting individuals, organizations, and society from malicious actors.

Project Description
VALID is built to tackle the challenges of deepfake detection in images, videos, and audio using AI technologies. The project uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively detect fake media. The system is designed to be highly scalable, adaptable, and able to analyze different types of media for deepfake detection.

Features
Deepfake Detection: Identifies manipulated media across images, videos, and audio.
AI Models: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to classify real vs. fake content.
User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for simple interaction with the model.
Scalability: The system can be integrated with digital platforms to check media authenticity.
